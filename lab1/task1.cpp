// Q1. Create a Student class that stores a studentâ€™s name and marks for three subjects using DMA.
// Include functions to set the marks and display the average score. In your program, implement
// shallow copy by creating one student object, set their marks, and then create another object as a
// copy of the first. Display the average for both and observe what happens when the original object
// is destroyed. Then observes the shallow copy problem.
